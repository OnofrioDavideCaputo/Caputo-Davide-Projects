abstract = {Abstract 2D magnets represent material systems in which magnetic order and topological phase transitions can be observed. Based on these phenomena, novel types of computing architectures and magnetoelectronic devices can be envisaged. Unlike conventional magnetic films, their magnetism is independent of the substrate and interface qualities, and 2D magnetic properties manifest even in formally bulk single crystals. However, 2D magnetism in layered materials is rarely reported often due to weak exchange interactions and magnetic anisotropy, and low magnetic transition temperatures. Here, the electron spin resonance (ESR) properties of a layered antiferromagnetic CrSBr single crystal are reported. The W-like shape angular dependence of the ESR linewidth provides a signature for room temperature spin–spin correlations and for the XY spin model. By approaching the Néel temperature the arising of competing intralayer ferromagnetic and interlayer antiferromagnetic interactions might lead to the formation of vortex and antivortex pairs. This argument is inferred by modeling the temperature dependence of the ESR linewidth with the topological Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition. These findings together with the chemical stability and semiconducting properties, make CrSBr a promising layered magnet for future magneto- and topological-electronics.},

abstract = {Abstract The recent discovery of magnetism within the family of exfoliatable van der Waals (vdW) compounds has attracted considerable interest in these materials for both fundamental research and technological applications. However, current vdW magnets are limited by their extreme sensitivity to air, low ordering temperatures, and poor charge transport properties. Here the magnetic and electronic properties of CrSBr are reported, an air-stable vdW antiferromagnetic semiconductor that readily cleaves perpendicular to the stacking axis. Below its Néel temperature, TN = 132 ± 1 K, CrSBr adopts an A-type antiferromagnetic structure with each individual layer ferromagnetically ordered internally and the layers coupled antiferromagnetically along the stacking direction. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) reveal that the electronic gap is ΔE = 1.5 ± 0.2 eV with a corresponding PL peak centered at 1.25 ± 0.07 eV. Using magnetotransport measurements, strong coupling between magnetic order and transport properties in CrSBr is demonstrated, leading to a large negative magnetoresistance response that is unique among vdW materials. These findings establish CrSBr as a promising material platform for increasing the applicability of vdW magnets to the field of spin-based electronics.},

abstract = {The contribution that the technique of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) has made to the understanding of the magnetic behaviour of ultrathin single films is reviewed. Experimental methods to measure FMR  in situ in ultrahigh vacuum are presented. The  temperature dependence of the magnetization, of the magnetic relaxation rate in the vicinity of the Curie temperature, and of the second- and fourth-order magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) constants can be measured by FMR  in situ for magnetic monolayers. Using the cases of Ni/Cu(001) and Gd/W(110) as examples, the role of the MAE for the quantitative description of temperature- and thickness-dependent reorientation transitions of the magnetization is discussed. Initial results for the anisotropy of the g-factor which is related to the anisotropy of the orbital moment (and the MAE) are presented.}

abstract  ="Here{,} we investigate the role of the interlayer magnetic ordering of CrSBr in the framework of ab initio calculations and by using optical spectroscopy techniques. These combined studies allow us to unambiguously determine the nature of the optical transitions. In particular{,} photoreflectance measurements{,} sensitive to the direct transitions{,} have been carried out for the first time. We have demonstrated that optically induced band-to-band transitions visible in optical measurement are remarkably well assigned to the band structure by the momentum matrix elements and energy differences for the magnetic ground state (A-AFM). In addition{,} our study reveals significant differences in electronic properties for two different interlayer magnetic phases. When the magnetic ordering of A-AFM to FM is changed{,} the crucial modification of the band structure reflected in the direct-to-indirect band gap transition and the significant splitting of the conduction bands along the Γ–Z direction are obtained. In addition{,} Raman measurements demonstrate a splitting between the in-plane modes B22g/B23g{,} which is temperature dependent and can be assigned to different interlayer magnetic states{,} corroborated by the DFT+U study. Moreover{,} the B22g mode has not been experimentally observed before. Finally{,} our results point out the origin of interlayer magnetism{,} which can be attributed to electronic rather than structural properties. Our results reveal a new approach for tuning the optical and electronic properties of van der Waals magnets by controlling the interlayer magnetic ordering in adjacent layers."}

abstract = {Abstract 2D magnetic materials offer unprecedented opportunities for fundamental and applied research in spintronics and magnonics. Beyond the pioneering studies on 2D CrI3 and Cr2Ge2Te6, the field has expanded to 2D antiferromagnets exhibiting different spin anisotropies and textures. Of particular interest is the layered metamagnet CrSBr, a relatively air-stable semiconductor formed by antiferromagnetically-coupled ferromagnetic layers (Tc∼150 K) that can be exfoliated down to the single-layer. It presents a complex magnetic behavior with a dynamic magnetic crossover, exhibiting a low-temperature hidden-order below T*∼40 K. Here, the magneto-transport properties of CrSBr vertical heterostructures in the 2D limit are inspected. The results demonstrate the marked low-dimensional character of the ferromagnetic monolayer, with short-range correlations above Tc and an Ising-type in-plane anisotropy, being the spins spontaneously aligned along the easy axis b below Tc. By applying moderate magnetic fields along a and c axes, a spin-reorientation occurs, leading to a magnetoresistance enhancement below T*. In multilayers, a spin-valve behavior is observed, with negative magnetoresistance strongly enhanced along the three directions below T*. These results show that CrSBr monolayer/bilayer provides an ideal platform for studying and controlling field-induced phenomena in two-dimensions, offering new insights regarding 2D magnets and their integration into vertical spintronic devices.},
