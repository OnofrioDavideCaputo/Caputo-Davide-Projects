CODE DEVELOPED TO OBTAIN INFORMATION REGUARDING THE DIFFUSION PROCESS ACTIVATION ENERGY AT THE CU-AL INTERFACE IN A 
BALL BOND-BOND PAD SYSTEM. THE RESULTS OBTAINED WITH THIS METHODOLOGY HAVE BEEN COMPARED WITH THE ONES OBTAINED THROUGH
THE USE OF A IMCS THICKNESS RECONGITION CNN-IMAGE PROCESSING ALORIGHM BASED ON THE ARRHENIUS LAW.

IN THIS CODE AN INTERPOLATION PROCESS CAN BE FOUND TOGETHER WITH A LINEAR REGRESSION STEP, IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION
ON THE ACTIVATION ENERGY INVOLVED IN THE DIFFUSIVE PROCESS, STARTING FROM THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA COLLECTED DURING THE ELECTRICAL
MEASUREMENT SESSIONS.
