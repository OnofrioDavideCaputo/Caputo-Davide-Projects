CNN IMAGE PROCESSING ALGORITHM DEVELOPED DURING MY MASTER'S THESIS WORK.

THIS HAS BEEN USED IN ORDER TO BETTER EVALUATE THE AVERAGE INTERMETALLIC COMPUNDS LAYERS TICKNESS, HENCE
ALLOWING A MORE PRECISE ESTIMATION OF THE DIFFUSION PROCESS ACTIVATION ENERGY.

DATA COLLECTED DURING THE STUDY AND ANALYZED WITH THIS ALGORITHM HAVE SHOWN, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A STUDY
CONDUCTED BY "STMICROELECTRONICS", A VALUE LOWER THAN 1,1 EV, THUS CONFIRMING ITS OVERESTIMATION.
