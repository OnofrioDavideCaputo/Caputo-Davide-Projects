CNN IMAGE PROCESSING algorithm developed during my thesis work.

This has been used in order to better evaluate the average intermetallic compunds layers tickness, hence
allowing a more precise estimation of the diffusion process activation energy.

Data collected during the study and analyzed with this algorithm have shown, for the first time in a study
conducted by "STMicroelectronics", a value lower than 1,1 eV, thus confirming its overestimation.
